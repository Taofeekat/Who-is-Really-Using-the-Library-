# Who-is-Really-Using-the-Library-
Public libraries are more than just buildings full of books—they’re evolving community hubs. But with the rise of digital media and changing user habits, many libraries are asking the same question: “Are people still coming in, and if not, how are they using our services?”  I wanted to explore this shift through data.
By analyzing user engagement—physical visits, event attendance, and digital borrowing—I aimed to uncover who’s really using the library, how their behavior has changed over time, and what insights can help improve outreach, programming, and digital strategy.
Libraries, like many public institutions, often lack the tools to easily visualize user data. This dashboard helps fill that gap in a way that's easy to understand and present to stakeholders.
